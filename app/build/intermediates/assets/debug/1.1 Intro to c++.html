C++ is a general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.<br>
C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.<br><br>
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Laboratories in the early 1980's, and is based on the C language. 
The "++" is a syntactic construct used in C (to increment a variable), and C++ is intended as an incremental improvement of C. 
Most of C is a subset of C++, so that most C programs can be compiled (i.e. converted into a series of low-level instructions that the computer can execute directly) using a C++ compiler. <br>
C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.<br><br>

C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:<br>
- Encapsulation<br>
- Data hiding<br>
- Inheritance<br>
- Polymorphism<br><br>

<b><font color="#E91E00">Use of C++</font></b><br><br>

- C++ is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers in essentially every application domain.<br><br>
- In Adobe Systems All major applications are developed in C++: Photoshop & ImageReady, Illustrator, Acrobat, InDesign, GoLive<br><br>
- C++ is widely used for teaching and research because it is clean enough for successful teaching of basic concepts.<br><br>
- Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.<br><br>
- Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia & many more companies uses C++ language.
