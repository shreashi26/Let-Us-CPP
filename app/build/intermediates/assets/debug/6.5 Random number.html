C (and by extension C++) comes with a built-in pseudo-random number generator. It is implemented as two separate functions that live in the cstdlib header:<br>

srand() sets the initial seed value. srand() should only be called once.<br>

rand() generates the next random number in the sequence (starting from the seed set by srand()).<br><br>

Here’s a sample program using these functions:<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
    int count;<br>
    srand(5323);<br> // set initial seed value to 5323<br><br>
 
    // Print 10 random numbers<br>
    for (i=0; i &lt; 10; i++)<br>
    {<br>
        cout &lt;&lt; rand() &lt;&lt; "\t";<br>
    }<br>
}<br><br>

The output of this program will be any 10 numbers.<br><br>

rand() generates pseudo-random integers between 0 and RAND_MAX, a constant in stdlib that is typically set to 32767.<br><br>
Generally, we do not want random numbers between 0 and RAND_MAX — we want numbers between two other values, which we’ll call Low and High.<br> 
For example, if we’re trying to simulate the user rolling a dice, we want random numbers between 1 and 6.<br><br>

It turns out it’s quite easy to take the result of rand() can convert it into whatever range we want:<br>
// Generate a random number between Low and High (inclusive)<br>
unsigned int GetRandomNumber(int Low, int High)<br>
{<br>
    return (rand() % (High - Low + 1)) + Low;<br>
}
