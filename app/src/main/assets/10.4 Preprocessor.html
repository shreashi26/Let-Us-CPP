The preprocessors are the directives, which give instruction to the compiler to preprocess the information before actual compilation starts.<br>
All preprocessor directives begin with #, and only white-space characters may appear before a preprocessor directive on a line. 
Preprocessor directives are not C++ statements, so they do not end in a semicolon (;). We already know #include directive.<br><br>

Different preprocessor directives (commands) perform different tasks. We can categorize the Preprocessor Directives as follows:<br>
- Inclusion Directives
- Macro Definition Directives
- Conditional Compilation Directives

<b><font color="#E91E00">Inclusion Directive</font></b><br>
This category has only one directive, which is called #include. This inclusion directive is used to include files into the current file. The inclusion directive can be used as follows:<br>
<b>#include &lt;stdio.h></b><br>	includes stdio.h from include folder<br>
<b>#include&lt;iostream></b><br>	includes cpp class library header iostream<br>
<b>#include&lt;my.cpp></b><br>	includes my.cpp file from include folder<br>
<b>#include ''my.h''</b><br>	includes my.h file from current working folder<br><br>

<b><font color="#E91E00">Macro Definition Directives</font></b><br>
These are used to define macros, which are one, or more program statements (like functions) and they are expanded inline.<br>
There are two directives for Macro Definition:<br>

<b>#define</b> - Used to define a macro<br>
<b>#undef</b> - Used to undefine a macro (The macro cannot be used after it is undefined.)<br><br>

<b><font color="#E91E00">Conditional Compilation Directives</font></b><br>
Conditional Compilation Directives these are used to execute statements conditionally for:<br>
- Executing the code on different machine architectures.<br>
- Debugging purposes.<br>
- Macros can be dependent on other macros (must be defined before they are used.)<br>
- Evaluating codes, which are to be executed depending upon the requirements of the programmer.<br><br>

The following directives are included in this category:<br>
#if<br>
#elif<br>
#endif<br>
#ifdef<br>
#ifndef<br><br><br>

<b>Note:</b> These macros are evaluated on compile time. Therefore they can only use the predefined macros or literals. Most compilers do not support the use of variables with these directives.
