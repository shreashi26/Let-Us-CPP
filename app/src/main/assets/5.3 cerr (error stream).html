The predefined object cerr is an instance of iostream class. The cerr object is said to be attached to the standard error device, 
which is also a display screen but the object cerr is un-buffered and each stream insertion to cerr causes its output to appear immediately.<br><br>
The cerr is also used in conjunction with the stream insertion operator as shown in the following example.<br>
int main( )<br>
{<br>
char str[] = "Unable to read....";<br>
cerr &lt;&lt; "Error message : " << str << endl;<br>
}<br><br>
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:<br>
Error message : Unable to read....
