C++ allows us to create own own data types. <br>
enumerated type is the simplest method for doing so.<br> 
An enumerated type is a data type where every possible value is defined as a symbolic constant (called an enumerator). 
enum keyword is used to declare Enumerated types. <br><br>

Example:<br>

// define a new enum named Brand<br>
enum Brand<br>
{<br>
    // Here are the enumerators<br>
    // These define all the possible values this type can hold<br>
    Brand_LEE,<br>
    Brand_Reebok,<br>
    Brand_Cooper,<br>
    Brand_Fila<br>
};<br><br>
 
// Declare a variable of enumerated type Brand<br>
Brand a_Brand = Brand_Fila;<br><br>

Memory is not allocated while defining an enumerated type. <br>
When a variable of the enumerated type is declared (such as a_Brand in the example above), memory is allocated for that variable at that time.<br><br>

Enum variables are the same size as an int variable. <br>
This is because each enumerator is automatically assigned an integer value based on itâ€™s position in the enumeration list.<br> 
By default, the first enumerator is assigned the integer value 0, and each subsequent enumerator has a value one greater than the previous enumerator:<br><br>

enum Brand<br>
{<br>
    Brand_LEE, // assigned 0<br>
    Brand_Reebok, // assigned 1<br>
    Brand_Cooper, // assigned 2<br>
    Brand_Fila // assigned 3<br>
};<br><br>
 
Brand a_Brand= Brand_Fila;<br>
cout &lt;&lt; a_Brand;<br>
The cout statement above prints the value 3.<br><br>

we can explicitly define the value of enumerator. <br>
Value of enumerator can be positive or negative and can be non-unique.<br> 
Any non-defined enumerators are given a value one greater than the previous enumerator.<br><br>

// define a new enum named Brand<br>
enum Brand<br>
{<br>
    Brand_LEE = -3,<br>
    Brand_Reebok, // assigned -2<br>
    Brand_Cooper, // assigned -1<br>
    Brand_Fila = 5,<br>
    Brand_Nike // assigned 6<br>
};<br><br>


<b><font color="#E91E00">typedef</font></b><br><br>
Typedefs allow the programmer to create an alias for a data type, and use the aliased name instead of the actual type name. 
To declare a typedef, simply use the typedef keyword, followed by the type to alias, followed by the alias name:<br><br>

typedef long Binary;<br> // define Binary as an alias for long<br><br>
 
// The following two statements are equivalent:<br>
long number;<br>
Binary number;<br>
A typedef does not define new type, but is just another name for an existing type. A typedef can be used anywhere a regular type can be used.<br><br>

Typedefs are used mainly for documentation and legibility purposes. <br>
Data type names such as char, int, long, double, and bool are good for describing what type of variable something is, 
but more often we want to know what purpose a variable serves. <br><br>

In the above example, long number does not give us any clue what type number is holding. <br>
Is it Binary, Hexadecimal, Octal or some other type? Binary number makes it clear what the type of number is.
